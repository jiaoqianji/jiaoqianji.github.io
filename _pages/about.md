## About Me
Hello, my name is __Jiao Qianji(焦乾稷)__ and I'm currently in my second year of pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Statistics at XiDian University.

I kind of wanna make a CV here so I don't have to prepare it for an interview, I mean, to apply a job, I have to organize my stuff, what have I done, who I am, and so on. So I wander why I just put it in here, just all info I need, and once I come up with the need to apply a job submit my CV, the only thing I need to do is to copy from this website and then delete something that is not relevant. Easy way to go. So that's it.
